# PYTHON PROGRAMMING - From Basic to Advanced

This project was born from the need to learn a new programming language useful for my university and professional development.  
It starts from the basics with simple exercises and progresses to more complex and advanced topics, including DBMS management with MySQL and exercises involving classes and objects.

## Project Structure

- **Basic Python tutorials**: `print`, math operations, logical operators, loops, functions, libraries.
- **Advanced Python tutorials**: lists, tuples, data formats, dictionaries, sets, classes, objects, strings, regular expressions, matrices, NumPy arrays.
- **OOP tutorials**: exercises with classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **UML diagrams**: created using the PlantUML tool.
- **SQL tutorials**: using the [W3Schools SQL editor](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_editor).
- **MySQL and PyMySQL**: installation and configuration of MySQL, interaction with Python through the `pymysql` module.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `random` module
- `re` module
- (optional) `numpy`, `pymysql`, `plantuml`
